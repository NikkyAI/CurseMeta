# CurseMeta

This website offers easy access to Minecraft's CurseForge's metadata about mods and modpacks.

The primary purpose is to allow third party modpack downloaders or launchers such as [MultiMC](https://multimc.org) or [CurseModpackDownloader](https://github.com/DoubleDoorDevelopment/CurseModpackDownloader) simple and easy access to said metadata.

All generated with publicly available data from Minecraft's CurseFoge. No mods are being hosted.

The JSON data is updated periodically, ideally hourly. (Just as fast as the Twitch launcher.)
