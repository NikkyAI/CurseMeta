# CurseMeta

CurseMeta is a Python based post processor for the output of [alpacka-meta](https://github.com/NikkyAI/alpacka-meta) files to suite my needs.

This repository will also server for any issues with the web service associated with this project.

A hosted version at [https://cursemeta.dries007.net/](https://cursemeta.dries007.net/).

The index.html page is generated with [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) and the [Pixyll](http://theme.typora.io/theme/Pixyll/) theme.
The space above the \<h1> is removed by adding `style="margin-top: 0"` manually.
